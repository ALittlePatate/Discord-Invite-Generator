# Discord-Invite-Generator
Generate and check random discord invites

# Usage
python main.py

# Features
The generator is checking the invites for you.
Saving results into [date and time]/good.txt and [date and time]/bad.txt.
You can choose if you want colors or not.

# Known issues
* Every ~50 checks, discord will ban you from the api, the solution is to wait 22 sec after these 51 checks. The program is doing so but i wonder if we can bypass/find another solution for this limit.
